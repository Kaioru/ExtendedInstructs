# ExtendedInstructs
A Extended Commands Module written with the [Instructability API](https://github.com/Kaioru/Instructability) for [Discord4J](https://github.com/austinv11/Discord4J) 

This project acts as an example, reference and a general utility command suite for Instructability.

## How to install
### Step 1: Downloading required libraries
Luckily for you, ExtendedInstructs only requires Instructability to run. Please check with the ExtendedInstructs [releases](https://github.com/Kaioru/ExtendedInstructs/releases) page to see which version of Instructability to download.
### Step 2: Place in modules folder
Then, place the 'ExtendedInstructs' and 'Instructability' jar files in your modules directory or as required by your bot. Discord4J will load them automagically and ExtendedInstructs is now installed, woo!
